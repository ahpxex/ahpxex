## AHpx's manual

**I started my software engineering journey at middle school, having some experiences in:**

- Multiple programming languages, including TypeScript, C#, Python
- Building full-stack web applications with Next.Js, React + FastAPI
- Dabbling with databases like PostgreSQL, SQLite and (superbase, neon stuff)
- Deploy with CI/CD pipelines and automated tests (which I often neglect)

**But I'm currently thinking about turning into a Full-stack Product Engineer, and by this term I mean:**

- To ship a product by myself, with all the technical and marketing skills
- Still dive deeper in programming, but towards the direction to be a conductor of AI orchestra
- Deliver some really aesthetical products, focus on growth, yet my value is tend to be Altruistic, that I want to build products to help human to be better

**Besides all of these identities, I'm also a:**

- Photog, taking street and abstractish photos randomly
- Biker, for both motorcycle and bicycle
- Guy loving sport, read and art stuff (this is meaningless declaration though, but trust me, I'm artsy)
